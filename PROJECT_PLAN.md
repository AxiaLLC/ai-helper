## üîß TECHNICAL PATTERNS

### **Established Patterns**
- **[Pattern 1]**: [Description of established development pattern]
- **[Pattern 2]**: [Description of established workflow pattern]
- **[Pattern 3]**: [Description of established deployment pattern]

### **Development Workflow**
1. Check Tasks.md board at localhost:8080 for active work (or use WIP.md checklist)
