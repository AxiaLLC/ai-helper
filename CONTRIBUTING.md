   - Which template files are affected

### üí° Suggesting Features

We welcome suggestions for improving the template:

1. **Check existing feature requests** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create a new issue** using the feature request template
3. **Describe your use case** and how the feature would help
4. **Consider different project types** - how would this work for web apps, research, content creation, legal work, etc.

### üîß Contributing Code

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-helper-template.git
   cd ai-helper-template
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Making Changes

1. **Test your changes** with an AI assistant (Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.)
2. **Validate across use cases** - try your changes with different project types
3. **Update documentation** if you're changing template structure or workflow
4. **Add or update examples** if your changes affect how the template is used

#### Template File Guidelines

When modifying template files:

- **Keep placeholders generic** - use `[PROJECT NAME]`, `[Date]`, etc.
- **Maintain consistent formatting** - follow existing markdown structure
- **Preserve the information temperature system** (Hot/Warm/Cold files)
- **Test with real AI interactions** - ensure the template actually improves AI collaboration

#### Example Implementation Guidelines

When adding or updating examples:

- **Make them realistic** - use concrete but generic project scenarios
- **Include complete workflows** - show the full AI collaboration pattern
- **Provide clear setup instructions** - users should be able to follow along easily
- **Test the examples** - ensure they work as documented

#### Submitting Changes

1. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add legal team example with contract analysis workflow"
   ```
2. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Create a pull request** using the provided template
4. **Respond to feedback** and make requested changes

### üìö Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- **Fix typos or unclear instructions**
- **Add missing information** about workflows or setup
- **Improve examples** with better explanations
- **Add new use cases** or project type examples

### üß™ Testing Guidelines

Before submitting changes:

1. **Test with an AI assistant** - verify the template actually works
2. **Try different project types** - ensure changes work across use cases
3. **Check all links and references** - make sure everything is accessible
4. **Validate the workflow** - follow the complete setup and usage process

## Development Principles

### Template Design Philosophy

- **Rapid Context Acquisition** - AI should understand project state in <5 minutes
- **Checklist-Driven Confirmation** - All work happens via confirmed task lists
- **Information Temperature Management** - Hot files for immediate context, warm for detailed work, cold for archives
- **Self-Maintaining Documentation** - Template enforces good documentation habits

### Code Style

- **Markdown formatting** - Use consistent headers, lists, and code blocks
- **Clear placeholders** - Make it obvious what users need to customize
- **Logical organization** - Group related information together
- **Concise but complete** - Provide enough detail without overwhelming

### Compatibility

- **Cross-platform** - Template should work on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **AI tool agnostic** - Should work with Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- **Project type flexible** - Core patterns should apply across different domains

## Community Guidelines

### Be Respectful

- **Use inclusive language** in all communications
- **Respect different perspectives** on AI collaboration and project management
- **Provide constructive feedback** when reviewing contributions

### Be Helpful

- **Share your experience** with different AI tools and workflows
- **Help newcomers** understand the template and its benefits
- **Contribute to discussions** about improving AI collaboration patterns

### Be Collaborative

- **Work together** to solve problems and improve the template
- **Share knowledge** about effective AI collaboration techniques
- **Build on each other's ideas** to create better solutions
