## üéØ PROJECT VISION

### **What We're Building**
TaskFlow: A modern task management web application that combines intuitive project organization with AI-powered productivity insights. Users can create projects, manage tasks, track time, and receive intelligent recommendations for improving their workflow.

### **Why It Matters**  
Existing task management tools are either too simple (missing advanced features) or too complex (overwhelming for small teams). TaskFlow bridges this gap with smart defaults, AI insights, and a clean interface that scales from personal use to team collaboration.

### **Success Criteria**
- MVP launched with core task management features functional
- User authentication and data persistence working reliably
- AI insights providing measurable value to user productivity
- Clean, responsive UI that works across desktop and mobile

## üèóÔ∏è CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend)
- **External Integrations**: OpenAI API, SendGrid, Stripe

### **Key Components**
1. **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens and secure session management
2. **Project Management**: Hierarchical project/task structure with categories and tags
3. **Time Tracking**: Built-in timer with automatic time logging and reporting
4. **AI Insights Engine**: Productivity analysis and intelligent task recommendations

### **Data Flow**
User creates account ‚Üí sets up projects ‚Üí adds tasks ‚Üí tracks time ‚Üí AI analyzes patterns ‚Üí provides insights ‚Üí user optimizes workflow based on recommendations

## üìã CURRENT ROADMAP

### **Phase 1: Core MVP** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è *Current Phase*
**Goal**: Basic task management functionality operational  
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] User authentication and account management
- [ ] Project creation and organization
- [ ] Task CRUD operations with status tracking
- [ ] Basic time tracking functionality

### **Phase 2: AI Integration**
**Goal**: Add intelligent productivity insights  
**Dependencies**: Core MVP complete, user data collection established  
**Key Features**:
- Productivity pattern analysis
- Task completion time predictions
- Intelligent task prioritization suggestions
- Weekly productivity reports

### **Phase 3: Team Collaboration**
**Goal**: Multi-user project collaboration  
**Considerations**: Real-time updates, permission management, team analytics

## üîß TECHNICAL PATTERNS

### **Established Patterns**
- **Component Architecture**: Atomic design with reusable UI components in src/components/
- **State Management**: React Context for global state, React Query for server state
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling and validation

### **Development Workflow**
1. Check Tasks.md board at localhost:8080 for active work
2. Update WIP.md with session progress and discoveries
3. Follow checklist-driven confirmation with user before significant changes
4. Use task-driven Git commits with proper task references

### **Git Architecture**
- **Task-Driven Commits**: All commits reference specific task cards
- **Task Integration**: Task files track progress and relevant commits
- **Regular Commits**: Prevent work loss, enable collaboration
- **Clean Repository**: Comprehensive .gitignore patterns
- **Feature Branches**: Short-lived branches for each major feature

### **Deployment Process**
Automated deployment via Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend) with environment-specific configurations and database migrations

## üö® CURRENT CONSTRAINTS

### **Technical Constraints**
- Single developer with AI collaboration for initial development
- Need to balance feature richness with development speed

### **Resource Constraints** 
- Bootstrap budget requiring cost-effective infrastructure choices
- External API costs (OpenAI) need monitoring and optimization

### **Business Constraints**
- Need to validate product-market fit before expanding team
- Competition from established players requires differentiation

## üìä DECISION FRAMEWORK

### **Technology Choices**
**When choosing new tools/libraries, prioritize**:
1. TypeScript compatibility and strong type safety
2. Active community and good documentation
3. Performance impact and bundle size considerations

### **Feature Prioritization**
**When deciding on new features, consider**:
1. Impact on core user workflow and productivity
2. Development complexity vs. user value delivered
3. Differentiation from existing task management tools
