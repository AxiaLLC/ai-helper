# Legal Team Example - AI Helper Template

This example shows how to use the AI Helper Template for legal work including contract analysis, document drafting, legal research, and case preparation.

## Project Context

**Type**: Legal analysis and document preparation  
**Team Size**: 1-3 legal professionals + AI collaboration  
**AI Collaboration**: Heavy use for research, document review, and drafting assistance  

## Setup Process

1. **Copy template files to your legal project**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ai-helper-template/* your-legal-project/
   ```

2. **Customize PROJECT_PLAN.md**:
   - Replace `[PROJECT NAME]` with your case or project name
   - Define your legal objectives and client requirements
   - Outline your research strategy and deliverables
   - Set your timeline and key deadlines

3. **Initialize WIP.md**:
   - Set your current legal work phase (research, analysis, drafting, review)
   - Create checklists for each legal task or document
   - Track progress on research and document preparation

4. **Set up task management**:
   - Use file-based task management for legal workflows
   - Create folders for different case phases or document types

## Example Workflow

### Legal Research Phase

1. **Create research checklist in WIP.md**:
   ```markdown
   ### **Active Checklist** - Contract Law Research
   - [ ] Research relevant case law and precedents (Est: 3 hours)
   - [ ] Review applicable statutes and regulations (Est: 2 hours)
   - [ ] Analyze jurisdiction-specific requirements (Est: 1 hour)
   - [ ] Summarize key legal principles and risks (Est: 1.5 hours)
   ```

2. **AI Collaboration**: Use AI to help identify relevant cases, summarize legal principles, and suggest research directions

3. **Progress Tracking**: Update checklist as research is completed and legal analysis is documented

### Document Drafting Phase

1. **Drafting checklist**:
   ```markdown
   ### **Active Checklist** - Service Agreement Draft
   - [ ] Review client requirements and scope (Est: 30 min)
   - [ ] Draft initial contract structure and clauses (Est: 2 hours)
   - [ ] Review for compliance and risk mitigation (Est: 1 hour)
   - [ ] Prepare redlines and client comments (Est: 45 min)
   ```

2. **AI Assistance**: Use AI for clause suggestions, risk identification, and document formatting

## Technology Stack Example

```markdown
### **Technology Stack**
- **Document Management**: Microsoft Word, Google Docs with version control
- **Legal Research**: Westlaw, LexisNexis, or open legal databases
- **Case Management**: Clio, MyCase, or custom tracking systems
- **Collaboration**: SharePoint, Box, or secure file sharing
- **Time Tracking**: Legal-specific billing and time management tools
```
